End-to-end Data Science project
==============================

This is the repo with the notebooks, code, and additional material used in the ITI's workshop. The goal of the sessions was to illustrate the end-to-end process of an real project.

### Additional material
In addition to the notebooks and code, the following material is also available: 
+ **Video recordings** of the sessions are [uploaded to youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLatl6hdtJ0RkUSCChqOAVhnv5juWaoAyK)
+ **Slide decks** are also added to this repo [here](https://github.com/Deena-Gergis/iti_ds_live/tree/master/slide_decks)

### Problem statement
> Our (fictional) client is an IT educational institute. They have reached out to us has reach out with the following:
“IT jobs and technologies keep evolving quickly. This makes our field to be one of the most interesting out there. But on the other hand, such fast development confuses our students. They do not know which skills they need to learn for which job. 
“Do I need to learn C++ to be a Data Scientist?” “Do DevOps and System admins use the same technologies?” “I really like JavaScript; can I use it in Data Analytics?” Those are some of the questions that our students ask. 
Could you please develop a data-driven solution for our students to answer such questions? They mostly want to understand the relationships between the jobs and the technologies.
